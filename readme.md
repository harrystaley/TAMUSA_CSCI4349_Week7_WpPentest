  - [ ] Affected source code:
    - [wp-db.php](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/4.2/src/wp-includes/wp-db.php)

2. Username Enumeration Provided via HTTP GET Request for using author id.
  - [ ] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types: User Enumeration

    ![image walkthrough](./images/WP_author_userid_enumeration.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate:
    In this exploit we will gather information about the user ids avaialble via the author interface.
    1. in your browser enter ```http://wpdistillery.com?author=<author id>``` and insert a number for one of the authors.
      in our case we wil use ```http://wpdistillery.com?author=1```
    2. look at the redirected URL ```http://wpdistillery.vm/author/<user id>/ ```
      in our sample case we will be redirected to ```http://wpdistillery.vm/author/admin/``` where admin is our returned user name.

4. Directory Traversal and Informaiton Exposure
  - [ ] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types: Information Overexposure
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - [CVE 548](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/548.html)
    - Fixed in version: unknown
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough:

  - [ ] Steps to recreate:
    1. navigate to [/wp-admin/css](http://wpdistillery/wp-admin/css) or [/wp-admin/js](http://wpdistillery.vm/wp-admin/js/)
    2. Take a look at all of the files available to you.
  - [ ] Affected source code:
    N/A

5. Delete Plugin Path Traversal/Arbitrary File Deletion
  - [ ] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types: Information Overexposure
    - Tested in version: 4.2
    - Fixed in version: unknown
    - This vulnerability should be fixed because it allows you to arbritrarially delete files through a get request.
    - This to my research has not been fixed. Some might say that this s not a vulnerability, but the person who is the Wordpress Admin may not be a system administrator and thus the user should be protected from inadvertant deletion.
    - [Proof of Concept Confirmed](https://www.homelab.it/index.php/2014/08/06/wordpress-3-4-vulnerabilities/)
    - [CVE 548](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/548.html)
  - [ ] GIF Walkthrough:
    ![image walkthrough](./images/WP_plugin_directory_enumeration_destructuve_Delete.gif)
  - [ ] Steps to recreate: 
    1. Log in as Administrator
    2. Click on plugins
    3. Click Delete on your desired plugin.
    4. Click link ```Click to view entire list of files to be deleted```
    5. click the link again to close the list.
    6. In the address bar look at the address ```http://wpdistillery.vm/wp-admin/plugins.php?action=delete-selected&checked%5B0%5D=<FILES HERE>&plugin_status=all&paged=1&s&_wpnonce=25c604f1f7```
    7. Replace the text located at ```<FILES HERE>``` with whatever you wish to navigate to.
    8. For our example lets replace it with ```./../../../```
    9. You will now see other files.
    10. you can click delete to delete files other than those you intend to delete for the given plugin.
  - [ ] Affected source code:
    - [plugins.php](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/branches/4.2/src/wp-admin/plugins.php)

## Assets

  ```WP_<=_4.2_Unauthenticated_Stored_XSS.js```

## Resources

- [WordPress Source Browser](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/)
- [WordPress Developer Reference](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/)

GIFs created with [LiceCap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/).

## Notes

LiceCap initially did not capture anything but a black screen on Mac OSX 10.14 Mojave when I was using an external monitor, but I restarted my computer and it worked.
I also initially had some trouble finding the hover target due to screen magnification issues for the first pentest which is why the video went kind of longer, but I ended up demonstrating it without any issues.
I spent a great deal of time researching ways to execute additional vulnerabilities not listed in WPScan.
All vulnerabilites were executed on WP Core. I was also looking at SQL injection vulnerabilities, but the ones that I have found seemed to be very severe, but there also seem to be a glut of XSS attacks.
Attack number five could be executed using a XSS from attack one combined with attack five.
